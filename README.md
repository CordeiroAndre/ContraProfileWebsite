# Contra Profile Website
A unique and minimalistic profile website made out only with HTML, CSS and other free tools.

 - Following the design style of [Contra design System](https://www.figma.com/community/file/833515051385038928) 
 - 3D Model Modeled by Me 
 - Used [Spline](https://spline.design) to generate the iframe wich renders the 3D model.
-  Everything else made with standart HTML5, CSS3, and JS
